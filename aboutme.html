                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am currently in my second semester of studies in Java Development at STI. Throughout my coursework, I have gained valuable knowledge in Java, databases, and the basics of web development. As I delve deeper into these technologies, I am eager to expand my skills and explore more advanced areas of programming.</p>
                <p>Before pursuing a career in tech, I worked as a recruiter in the tech industry. This experience gave me firsthand insight into the fast-paced and dynamic nature of the field. Witnessing the continuous growth and profound social impact of technology—improving quality of life, facilitating learning, and creating new opportunities—inspired me to shift my career direction. I decided to become an active part of this revolution by learning new technologies and building a future in this exciting industry.</p>
                <p>Originally from Uruguay, I have been living in Sweden for five years. I am fluent in Spanish and English and I'm an enthusiastic learner of Swedish. I enjoy connecting with others through collaborative work and meaningful conversations. Outside of my professional pursuits, I am passionate about traveling, discovering new experiences, and nurturing my creativity. I also deeply value time spent with friends, family, and my lovely cat.</p>
                <p>I am excited to embrace new challenges and opportunities in the tech world.</p>
